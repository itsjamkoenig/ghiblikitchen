            What is Ghibli?
        </h5><br>
        <p>Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 by animated film directors Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki,
            and has produced twenty-two feature-length films. Most Studio Ghibli films ranked number one at
            the box office in Japan in the year in which they were released. Spirited Away, directed by Hayao
            Miyazaki and released in 2001, is the all-time highest grossing film in Japan, earning
            over 30 billion yen at the box office.
        <br><br>
            Studio Ghibli films have garnered numerous awards and critical acclaim from film critics and
            animation specialists around the world. Spirited Away was awarded the Golden Bear as the Best
            Feature Film at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival and won the 2002 Academy Award for
            Best Animated Feature Film. In October 2001, Studio Ghibli, in conjunction with The Tokuma Memorial
            Cultural Foundation for Animation, founded the Ghibli Museum, Mitaka, designed by Hayao Miyazaki.</p>
